//! Kernel-Defined Functions (KDFs) -- stateful per-row logic the kernel owns.
//!
//! KDFs encapsulate Delta-specific per-row work (checkpoint hint extraction,
//! protocol/metadata harvesting, sidecar collection) that engines can't interpret.
//!
//! The IR exposes one KDF shape: [`KernelReducer`], an observer over batches
//! returning `Continue` / `Break`. It's wired into a plan via
//! [`EngineRequest::Reduce`]; the reducer drains the terminal row stream and accumulates
//! finalized state for the engine to harvest.
//!
//! [`EngineRequest::Reduce`]: crate::plans::state_machines::framework::state_machine::EngineRequest::Reduce
//!
//! KDFs dispatch in-process and never cross a serialization boundary.
//!
//! Each [`ReducerHandle`] carries a [`KernelReducerToken`] (`{ kind, id }`, stamped at
//! plan-build time, keys the executor's state table and the paired [`Extractor`]).
